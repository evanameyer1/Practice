# Coding-Practice
Welcome to my coding practice repo! Here I have tried my best to document my full learning process. 

## For SQL: 
I learned SQL completely on Mode Analytics via their free lessons, until I worked my way up and passed their basic, intermediate, and advanced tests.
Then, after completing some easy, medium, and hard hackerrank problems, I basically jumped straight into SQL projects. The main SQL project where I made the most
progress was the CTA Rework project, so feel free to visit that repo to see most of my SQL skills and growth. 

> As of February 2023, I now also officially have my **HackerRank Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced SQL certifications.** I focus more of my current time on python, but
> I occasionally complete SQL hackerrank or codewars problems, and upload them here. 

## For Python:
I learned python through geeksforgeeks, then practicing with the problems I included in the self-teaching python folder. Then, I put in a lot of time on codewars
and have included all of those problems and my various answers in the codewars python folder. I practice python on codewars everyday, and will continue to upload
my problems here. 

> I'm still very new to python, with plans to continue to hone and grow my skills, and I plan on gaining some python certifications in the near future.
